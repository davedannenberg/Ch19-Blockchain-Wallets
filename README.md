# Ch19-Blockchain-Wallets

This project explored the use of Infura endpoints and integration with the Kovan testnet. The Python Web3 library was utilized extensively for the wallet and transaction development. Streamlit was used to launch the web application. Interactions with Streamlit are recorded to the Kovan testnet blockchain.

This is a photo of my Kovan wallet and the balance, as shown on Etherscan:
